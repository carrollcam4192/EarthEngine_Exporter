# Google EarthEngine Exporter

This repository contains a python notebook that takes a KML file and exports the region within the file to an image in the User's google drive. This code can be used in conjunction with Google earth Pro to precisely outline key regions of interest, and perform a batch export of satellite images, saving time when there are a lot of regions of interest.
